### A [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) application brought to you by [Mohawk Apps](http://www.mohawkapps.com/).

![App Icon](https://raw.github.com/MohawkApps/BeerJudge/master/resources/Icon@2x.png)

This app is the perfect companion for you at beer competitions! 

* Use the Flavor Wheel to explore and help identify different off flavors and aromas in a beer.
* Tap and drag around the SRM Spectrum to identify the closest SRM to the beer you're judging. 
* Use your device's camera to help you estimate a beer's SRM using the SRM Analysis tool! 

*SRM Analysis tool requires a device with camera capability.*
