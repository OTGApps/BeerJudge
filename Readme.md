This app is the perfect companion for you at beer competitions! 

* Use the Flavor Wheel to explore and help identify different off flavors and aromas in a beer.
* Tap and drag around the SRM Spectrum to identify the closest SRM to the beer you're judging. 
* Use your device's camera to help you estimate a beer's SRM using the SRM Analysis tool! 

*SRM Analysis tool requires a device with camera capability.*
